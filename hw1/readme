How to run:
Server:
	./server <port_number>
Client
	./client <host_name> <port_number>

port_number must be an integer > 2000
host_name is the IP addr of server. Put "localhost" in this field. Therefore the command becomes:
	./client loclahost <port_number>

Report is by the name of CN_Assignment_1_Report.pdf in the current directory.
Sreenshot is in wireshark_data directory.
Server code searches for the file name recursively in current directory.

test_dir has a file called hello_file which was used to test the code.

Please check out refereces for the list of resources that I looked at while writing code (apart from man pages).
